# Project-Tech
Repository of the tech project.
Welcome to the repository of "Blok Tech".

The semester has 3 courses:
* Front-end
* Back-end
* Project-Tech

## About this project
The goal of this project was to learn about the basics of Node.js, Git and Express.
With these tools I've build a filter-feature for a dating website.

I've build the dating app Amora. You can login to the app, change your preferences and go on the dating page. On the dating
page you can use the filter to manipulate the results.
